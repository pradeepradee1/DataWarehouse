# here only 1 map and 1 reduce task will get created



In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes): 
  	set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>                                                                                           
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
 	set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>                                                                                                         
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
	 set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number> 



# change number of reducers to 3

set mapreduce.job.reduces=3;

create table sales_order_grouped_orc_v1 stored as orc as select year_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id;


# after creating the table, check the number of files in hdfs location

# change number of reducers to 2

set mapreduce.job.reduces=2;

create table sales_order_grouped_orc_v2 stored as orc as select year_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id;


# after creating the table, check the number of files in hdfs location
